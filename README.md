# ATS-System

An applicant tracking system (ATS) is software for recruiters and employers to track candidates throughout the recruiting and hiring process. This software can come equipped with capabilities ranging from simple database functionality to a full-service suite of tools that makes it easy for businesses of any size to filter, manage, and analyze candidates.

Why use an applicant tracking system?
Every organization is unique, but each one thrives on attracting, hiring, and maximizing top talent. Many businesses face major challenges at some point in the hiring or onboarding process. An ATS can offer a variety of capabilities that can help the organization find, hire, and retain the best candidates. Some of the benefits of an ATS include the following:

Source and attract qualified candidates
Some organizations lack the reach to connect with top job seekers or to a cast a wide enough net in the marketplace. Others are missing critical data on the right channels to find specific candidates; other organizations may lack brand recognition and the means to develop it. An ATS can help address these critical candidate challenges. Some systems can be enriched with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to create a profile of an ideal candidate, assess and identify skills, and predict success factors to maximize each hire. This helps organizations better understand candidate behavior, amplify brand recognition, and target specific job seekers on the platforms and channels they use most.

Increase candidate engagement
Moving a candidate through the journey from first contact to start date can be a high-touch process. It can be all too easy to lose a top candidate because of slow response times or poor engagement around interview schedules. An ATS creates greater visibility across the applicant lifecycle, so touchpoints donâ€™t fall through the cracks.

Improve efficiency and lower costs
A reliance on inefficient manual processes, poor collaboration across the recruiting team, and miscommunication with key hiring stakeholders means that applicants move slowly through the hiring process. This leads to high cost-to-hire and time-to-hire ratios. An ATS creates opportunities to automate manual processes, increase visibility into the hiring cycle for the entire recruiting team, and increase opportunities for communication throughout the candidate journey.
